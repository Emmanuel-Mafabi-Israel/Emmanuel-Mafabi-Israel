Software Engineer | Machine Learning Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

Driven by a passion for engineering and a desire to make the world a better place through code and creativity. I thrive on exploring the vast landscape of technology, from the intricacies of operating systems to the magic of machine learning.  I believe in the power of lifelong learning and am always eager to research, explore, and contribute to the open-source community.



## 🚀 About Me

From June 2022, to September 2023, I worked as a Front-End Developer at **Khen Properties**, where I was responsible for building the front-facing side, specifically the user interface. The project was built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

My toolkit includes proficiency in a range of languages, allowing me to build robust and efficient solutions. I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of Machine Learning and am constantly exploring its applications.

Beyond my professional work, I dedicate my free time to personal projects, diving deeper into C++, Assembly, and Web Development.  I believe that continuous learning is key, and personal projects provide the perfect playground for experimentation and growth.



## 🌱 Currently Learning

* **Front-End Development:** Sharpening my skills in React.js and related technologies, with a focus on creating responsive, accessible, and performant user interfaces.

* **Back-End Development:** Enhancing my back-end skills with: Node.js, Python/Flask, Databases, focusing on building robust and scalable APIs.
