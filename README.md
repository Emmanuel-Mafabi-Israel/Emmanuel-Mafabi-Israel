## 🚀 About Me
Driven by a passion for engineering and a desire to make the world a better place through code and creativity. I thrive on exploring the vast landscape of technology, from the intricacies of operating systems to the magic of machine learning.  I believe in the power of lifelong learning and am always eager to research, explore, and contribute to the open-source community.
